# JavaScript-Random-Coding-Excercises
Some short coding JS exercise throughout my apprenticeship

This excercises were encountered during freecodecamp.org curriculum

The curriculum of Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures is as follows:

Basic Javascript --> Learn all the basics and some coding excercises. I knew the basics already but a refresher was welcomed

ES6 --> All the new applications of ES6 so you can write less and do more! Learn a lot of destructuring here, new sintax and more

Regular Expressions --> Learn all about ReGex and how to match regex in strings in all ways and forms
