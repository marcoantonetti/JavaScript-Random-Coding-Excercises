/*  Restrict Possible Usernames using ReGex

You need to check all the usernames in a database. Here are some simple rules that users have to follow when creating their username.

1 - Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.

2 - The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.

3 - Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

4 - Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters. */

let usernames = ["z97", 'JACK', 'Oceans11', 'BadUs3rnam3', 'c57bT3', 'J%4', 'AB1'];
let usernamesValidation = []
let userCheck = /^[a-z][a-z]+\d*$|^[a-z]\d\d+$/i; 

usernames.forEach((username) => {
usernamesValidation.push(userCheck.test(username))
} )

console.log(usernamesValidation)
